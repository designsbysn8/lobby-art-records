### Adding a new record

1) Add album covers to `images/album-covers/`
  - Big album cover (400 x 400 px). Sample name: `album-name_big.jpg`
  - Small album cover (260 x 260 px). Sample name: `album-name_small.jpg`

2) Add cassette mockup to `images/cassettes`. Sample name: `album-name.jpg`

3) Add new record page. I put specific instructions for this in `records/README.md`

4) Add press page (if desired). Instructions coming soon.

5) Add the new record to the `records.html` page. I left a comment in the file that shows you what you need to copy and paste.


This is the old list of things needed to add a new record that I had provided, keeping for reference.

- album name, artist, catalog number, etc etc
- small album cover (260 x 260)
- large album cover (400 x 400)
- casette mockup image (400 x 400)
- bandcamp link
- any page content (reviews, release date, etc)
