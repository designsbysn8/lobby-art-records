### Adding a new record

#### 1) Add album covers to `images/album-covers/`
We need to add two image files:
- Big album cover (400 x 400 px). Sample name: `album-name_big.jpg`
- Small album cover (260 x 260 px). Sample name: `album-name_small.jpg`

#### 2) Add cassette mockup to `images/cassettes`.
Sample name: `album-name.jpg`

#### 3) Add new record page. 
I put specific instructions for this in `records/README.md`. Once this is added you can access it at `www.lobbyartrecords.com/records/[album-name].html`. This is a good way to preview it and make sure everything looks good before you add it to the records page.

#### 4) Add the new record to the `records.html` page.
I left a comment in the file that shows you what you need to copy and paste.

#### 5) Add press page and/or one sheet (if desired).
Instructions coming soon.
