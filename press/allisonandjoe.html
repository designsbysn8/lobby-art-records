          <p>The concept of the musical duo exists within the notion that not one, but no more than two, can achieve a unity of sound, vision, and execution that renders the full band obsolete and the solo performer inadequate. History is littered with musical ingenuity at the molding of 4 hands coming together as one; John & Yoko, Kim & Thurston, Sonny & Cher, Hall & Oates.  The clarity of purpose and devotion present in a duo is due to the confidence each partner has in the other.  The unflinching belief that the next note the other plays will carry their unique pallete of sound within it. The beguiling debut album by Allison & Joe puts them in rarefied air.  Coming together in the evergreen mist of the northwest, the pair launched into their collaboration within the humble, ramshackle, and otherworldly confines of the D Street Arts Collective. A ragtag bunch of plodders, plotters, and humorists, an affinity for amateur wrestling and late night pizza slices set the scene for the budding partnership. But just as the creative molting process was taking place, a large jolt came in the shape of a cross country trek to the oft-ridiculed metropolis of Boston. Joe, having just fled that very scene, knew they had a hit album in them and decided to the band must live on. Shaping, honing, and perfecting a sound for any musician is a lifelong process.  You are always arriving.  So it makes it all the more incredible to hear the sound of two artists express such cohesiveness, depth, and character in their work.  Spread across the state of Massachusetts, Allison and Joe carry with them the sound of east and west, urban and rural, celestial and terrestrial.  As the great Jonathan Richman sung of his beloved bay state, <br><br>"I got the modern sounds of modern Massachusetts</br></br><br><br>I've got the world, got the turnpike, got the I've got the, got the power of the AM</br></br><br><br>Got the, late at night, hit 'em wide, rock & roll late at night</br></br><br><br>The factories and the auto signs got the power of modern sounds"</br></br><br><br>It's no wonder that Allison & Joe have produced such a brilliant sound of their own They've got the world, the turnpike, the rock n' roll late at night.  Its a modern sound, but a tale as old as time.  Love emits a natural sound, just as the ocean, wind, forest, and fields do.  Its natural and you know it when you hear it.  And you can hear it from this great duo. </br></br></p>
