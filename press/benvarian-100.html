Goal setting in late capitalism eerily reflects the very things that are unattainable in a capitalistic structure.  Solidity and assuredness are for those who can afford it.  
Impermanence and instability for the rest.  Naturally, when Ben Varian set out to record the music for "One Hundred Breakfasts with the Book", he had envisioned a 
simple rendering of his ideal pop album. Drums, bass, piano, some nice major and minor chords that he knew the names of.  
What Varian ended up producing is a zany, amorphous, and unpredictably beautiful telling of our imperfections.  
A votive for the beauty we shun that stares us in the face while embracing the potential of empty dreams and fantasies.  
Varian sums up this reflex when he sings in "Spend Some Time (With Your Mind)"

<br><i>Situps and pushups
And a room with a view
Cherries, strawberries
Maybe drugs will do it too
I know disaster, is my life-appointed coach
But like a housecat coming inside
I like to savor the approach</i>

<br>The promise of the fully realized self tantalizes yet ignores the true value inherent in our practice; our approach.  
The sculpted physique, the euphoria of a high are not ends unto themselves. 
They are myths that crush our beloved imperfections. 

<br>Throughout the album, Ben remains masterful at telling stories of the beauty in our imperfections.  
In the AM Gold hued "Period Chart", he talks of his treasured abode as, "...our crackerbox palace on the second floor where the piano almost blocks the door."  
On "The Floor is a Lady Too", he assures the anxious musician, "you may not have that gold record yet, but youâ€™re writing for the box set. One day you get closer to the Cheerios."  
Whether he is instructing an audience or doing some self-coaching, he never forgets that humor and levity are the ultimate myth busters. 

<br>Ben remains a trustworthy guide through the exploration of the self, making sure our plates are loaded and palettes are expanded;  never settling for standard singer-songwriter fare.  
Recalling the modal jazz missives of Herbie Hancock in "Wouldn't it be Nice", the Robert Wyatt bounce of "Portraits and Statues", and the David Berman country strut in "Goodbye Scoundrels", 
Ben's mood board is just as likely to induce a tear it is to bring your butt to the dance floor.           </p>

            Stevhen Peters is the music project of Stephen Peters.  Currently based in Los Angeles, Peters work contains the threads of his prior dwellings (North Carolina, Boston, New York, Portland, OR). Environment becomes the fulcrum in which Peters teases out universal musings on introspection, self-worth, and caring for one another in breakneck times.  Peters weaves 20th century minimalism with 60's indebted pop with an array of synthesizers, drum machines, and loops.  Melancholic at one turn and playful the next, Peters calls out everyday experiences (phone calls, bike rides, fast cars), cans them, and places them on the table for further analysis.          </p>
