            Arcane acoustic transmissions meet foggy electronics on the first full length effort from Portland,
            Oregon musician Dylan M Howe. On “Southern Gap”, Howe focuses on cavernous drones, decaying tape
            ambiance, and gentle rhythmic propulsion in the course of four compositions. Side A starts with the
            introspective acoustics of “Arcade Flutes”, with a flute drone echoing like a soft spoken voice in a
            pedestrian colonnade. It finishes with the pulsing ambient dub of “Rituals for Conscious Dying”, with the
            rattling melodica crooning like a factory worker grieving the loss of an era long since passed. Side B
            begins with “Ninety Blocks”, its synths warbling off the tape like a weary pedestrian in a dry winter and
            finishes up with the post-industrial ambience of “Courtyard”, with its distorted field recordings scraping
            knees with cerebral synthesizers.

            In their words, this is music for buildings that no longer serve a human purpose; a sonic embodiment of
            spaces that were once meant for dwelling but can function as such.

            Déjà Blue is a multi-instrumental manifestation of one sensual young mind blossoming into his own retro-futuristic grooves.  Originally a solo project of Oh, Rose drummer Liam Hindahl,  the outfit has recently grown five deep.  It's 4 am coffee music...walking through thigh-high daisy music...."I've got a crush on the rain" music. From a one-bed apartment above the city streets to a heavy meadow on the edge of town, Déjà Blue has been a secretive bedroom metamorphosis since it's inception.
