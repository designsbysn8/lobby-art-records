          <p>"...he says writing the new record taught him to be “more gentle
            with myself,” and this newfound gentleness courses through Tidings.
            It’s reflected in softer folk-pop sounds, with honeyed harmonies,
            jangly Stephen Steinbrink-esque guitars, and revelatory lines like
            “I’ll never burn/I was just waiting my turn/’Cause singin’ my song’s
            all I care about,” which he hopes echo the “dead-on, salt of the earth”
            lyrics of artists like Iris DeMent and Townes Van Zandt....Though
            Tidings is the product of major changes for Morris, it’s anything
            but backward looking—its songs resonate with the kind of infectious,
            wide-eyed joy that sounds ready for whatever’s next."

            "As the title suggests, Layperson’s new music explores “overlapping
            cycles.” Depending on the tide, we’re either neck-deep in rising
            water or have our feet firmly planted on solid ground. And while this
            pendulum can sound daunting, Layperson (otherwise known has Julian Morris)
            navigates these currents with a soft touch. His melodies are made
            with smooth lines, a buoyancy in the interplay between the strings
            and subtle glint off the piano riffs."
